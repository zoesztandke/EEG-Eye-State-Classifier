# EEG Eye-State Classification using Dimensionality Reduction and Machine Learning
This project investigates methods for classifying eye states (open vs. closed) from EEG recordings. The work focuses on preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and evaluation of classical machine learning algorithms. Initial experiments highlight the difficulty of separating eye-state classes in low-dimensional linear spaces. Smoothing techniques improve accuracy, and future work will explore additional approaches to enhance signal quality and class separability. 

## 1. Problem Overview
EEG data is noisy, high-dimensional, and often non-linearly separable, making eye-state classification challenging. The goal of this project is to design a workflow that:
1. Cleans and prepares raw EEG data
2. Reduces dimensionality to extract patterns
3. Evaluates performance of machine learning classifiers
4. Investigates smoothing methods to improve performance
